                            <li>1) Ali was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons. 
                                Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad and asked her to marry him after their first date. </li>

                                They quarreled over Sonji's refusal to join the Nation Of Islam.
                                According to Ali, "She wouldn't do what she was supposed to do. 
                                She wore lipstick; she went into bars; she dressed in clothes that were revealing and didn't look right."
